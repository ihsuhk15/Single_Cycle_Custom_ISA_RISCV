The processor supports a subset of the RV32I base instruction set along with three custom ISA extensions:

BITREV – Bit Reversal
POPCNT – Population Count
CLZ – Count Leading Zeros

Architecture:

Type: Single-cycle CPU
ISA Base: RV32I (subset)
Clock Cycles per Instruction (CPI): 1
Datapath: Non-pipelined
Memory Interface: Separate Instruction & Data Memory
Control Unit: Hardwired control logic
